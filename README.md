# OneProjectSite
This is one rather old example from the beginning of my learning of HTML and CSS.
I like this work, it is simple and beautiful.

A project about a website that 'should lead to different restaurants if you click on a certain dish'. 
But in fact, it only leads to one restaurant, no matter which menu you click on.
Maybe someday I'll add the rest of the restaurants that are listed there, if I'm in the right mood for it.
